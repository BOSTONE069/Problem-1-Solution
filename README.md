# Problem-1-Solution

This solution uses binary search to solve the problem. The idea is to keep track of the possible range of x using two variables l and r. The l variable represents the lower bound of the range, and the r variable represents the upper bound of the range. In each iteration, the midpoint mid of the range is checked against the function isTooSweet to determine if the cake is too sweet with mid teaspoons of sugar. If the cake is too sweet, the r variable is updated to mid to narrow down the range of possible x values. If the cake is not too sweet, the l variable is updated to mid + 1 to also narrow down the range of possible x values. The loop continues until l is equal to r, which is the first number of teaspoons of sugar that will make the cake too sweet. The final result is stored in l.
